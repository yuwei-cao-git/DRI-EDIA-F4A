# Workshop 3 Tutorial: Deep Learning in Forest Modeling
 
Welcome to this workshop's repository. Here you'll find the code tutorials we will run during the workshop.

There are two parts in for building a deep learning model in our workshop: Data preprocessing and Tree species classification.

## Data 
Our study area is located in Quebec.

## Data preprocessing
Please follow the steps in this [notebook](preprocess_data.ipynb)

## Model training
Please follow the steps in this [notebook](tree_species_classification). You can download the notebook or run it in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yuwei-cao-git/DRI-EDIA-F4A/blob/main/src/tree_species_classification/tree_species_classification.ipynb)
