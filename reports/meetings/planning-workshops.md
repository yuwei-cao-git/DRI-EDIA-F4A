## Intro to DRI-EDIA-F4A

The Digital Research Alliance of Canada (the Alliance) is launching a call for proposals for the DRI EDIA Champions pilot program, a $3.15 million dollar funding opportunity to support a new equity, diversity, inclusion, and accessibility (EDIA) initiative. 

This opportunity aims to increase awareness and uptake of the Alliance’s digital research infrastructure (DRI) by equity-seeking groups. 

Equitable access to DRI will strengthen the Canadian research ecosystem by ensuring equity-seeking individuals are DRI-informed and capable.

our project: **Advancing Equity in Forestry: Digital Research Infrastructure (DRI) and Deep Learning (DL) for All**

Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (EDIA) 
- actively promote and implement EDIA principles, specifically targeting the empowerment of women and other under-represented groups in forestry

Alliance DRI:
- Advanced Research Computing (ARC)
- Research Data Management (RDM)
- Artificial Intelligence
- Research Software

## Barries of women/under-represented groups in forestry
Education stage: 
- **Stereotypes and societal biases** often discourage young women from pursuing math and coding, leading to underrepresentation in these fields. (From Brianne!)
Early Career Stage：
- **Stereotypes and Biases**: women face entrenched stereotypes and biases that suggest they are less capable in STEM fields.
Mid-Career Stage:
- **Work-Life Balance and Career Interruptions**: women often face greater challenges in balancing work and family life. Besides, women are more likely to experience career interruptions, such as taking time off for childbearing or caregiving. This can lead to reduced research time and hinder career advancement.
Late Career Stage:
- **Lack of Representation and Visibility**: women remain underrepresented in leadership positions in STEM fields. This can lead to feelings of isolation and exclusion from important decision-making and opportunities

## What Advanced Computing, AI, remote sensing, and open science can do to empower women and other under-represented groups in forestry?
1. Open Science:
    - Promotion of Open Science: DRI promotes open science proficiency, facilitating collaboration and innovation across diverse research communities, increasing their visibility, and preparing them for advancement opportunities 
    - Publishing Code and Documentation: Publish code and technical documentation to support access to DRI and models

2. Cutting-edge Training and Resources:
    - Advanced Research Computing (ARC) & Research Data Management (RDM) Access: Empower researchers to advance their research goals efficiently and precisely in their early-stage careers.  (e.g., Traditional processes for estimating tree species proportions are time-consuming using LiDAR and DL techniques, Access to DRI trainings and resources will enable and accelerate the training of larger models and the systematic handling of extensive geospatial imagery and 3D point cloud data. This acceleration will not only allow me to effectively process vast amounts of geospatial datasets and complex AI models, but also speed up the discovery process, enabling and effective refinement of DL models.)Gain expertise in managing and storing geospatial data, 3D point clouds, and DL models throughout the research lifecycle.
    - Remote access to research data and computing resources, and virtual collaboration platforms, to help balance work and family life, overcome the challenges of career interruptions, and reintegrate into academia.

3. Domain-specific Alliance DRI Trainings:
    - AI and Machine Learning: Develop skills in applying AI and ML techniques to forestry studies with DRI.
    - Geographic Information Systems (GIS): Acquire knowledge in utilizing GIS applications in DRI, e.g., utilizing advanced spatial data processing tools (e.g., GDAL and QGIS) for spatial analysis and computation in forestry research

## Topics of Workshops
- Learn to utilize Alliance Resources tools for computationally and data-intensive research.
- Highlighting Open Science principles benefits during workshops.
- Highlight EDIA: by ensuring an inclusive environment in workshops and peer-to-peer sessions, workshop posters, highlighting in workshops, add stats like the percentage of women in forestry/STEM (Thanks Jing for this idea!)
- After each workshop, artists from [ThinkLink graphics](https://www.thinklinkgraphics.com/) will gather notes and synthesize them in a graphical illustration! 
Topics:
1. Open Science + Research Data Management in Forestry (two case studies: RDM in Wildfire + Vegetation dynamic modeling)
2. Advanced computing + Machine Learning (two case studies: Detect Forestry Structure Change + Predict Forest Adaption under Climate Change)
3. Advanced computing + Deep Learning (two case studies: Biomass Estimation + Tree Species Proportions Mapping)
