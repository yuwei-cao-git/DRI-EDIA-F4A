# Sarah's Presentation notes for the AI workshop on Borealis, the dataverse and more

## What is the Digital Alliance of Canada?

-   The Digital Alliance of Canada aims to provide technical and logistical support to support large computing and data-sharing across Canadian federally funded research
-   "The Alliance" for is the host of multiple different data repositories that range in their scope.
-   In addition to data repositories, the Alliance also offers technical training with the hope to standardize data reporting and storage for better research collaboration

## How does the Digital Alliance of Canada support Research Data Management?

-   Research Data Management is the process of *collection, documentation, storage, sharing and preservation of research data.* This allows for ebtter collaboration because we know more about how data was collected and where it can be accessed in the future
-   There are several data repositories managed directly by the Alliance
    -   The Federated Research Data Repository
    -   Lunaris
-   Other data repositories are supported by the Alliance
    -   Zenodo
    -   Borealis
-   The Alliance also includes some useful tools supporting RDM
    -   The DMP Assistant

## What is Borealis?

-   Starting the mid 2010s Canadian universities were searching for a reproducible, secure location to host and collaborate on data
-   This founded the Scholar's Portal which linked all Canadian University libraries together with a central location to host data on a secure platform
-   The Scholar's Portal was renamed in 2021 to "Borealis" which a Canadian Data Repository.
-   Borealis is a centralized location to store Canadian focused Data

## Requirements for Storing Data On Borealis
-   Be currently affiliated with a Canadian University (at UBC you will login with your CWL)
-   Research is stored underneath institutions (in this case this is UBC)
-   All research data must by anonymous 
-   Limited dataset size (5GB per file)

### Why use Borealis: 
-   UBC Specific community, known entity and easily searched meta-data 
-   Extensive technical support 
### Why not to use:
-   No DOI associated with data, and no ability to link to an established DOI 
-   Large files are not easily worked with 

### Borealis Demo
- There is a Demo Borealis dataset and also a dummy environemnet 

## What about Zenodo? 
-   Zenodo is a general-purpose open-access repository.
-   It allows researchers to deposit data sets, research software, reports, and any other research-related digital artifacts.
-   Zenodo was created by OpenAIRE and CERN to support the EU's Open Data policy.
-   It provides a DOI for all uploaded content, making it citable.
-   Zenodo supports versioning of datasets and other research outputs

### Sounds great - what's the catch? 
-   Metadata is limited 
-   There is no set-up for folders, so you have to be very careful in your naming if you are uploading many files 
-   Metadata for individual files is not supported

### Zenodo demo 
- Go over how we would upload the workshop into Zenodo 


## And finally UBC CIRcle 
-   At the end of your degree your are required to submit your thesis to UBC CIrcle 
-   In addition, you will be asked to add any additional data that is associated with your data 

### My Master's Data Demo
-   Show how we can find my thesis and associated data on for my masters.
