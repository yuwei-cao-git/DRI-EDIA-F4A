# Outline

1.  Welcome & Project Introduction

-   Brief introduction of the workshop goals and the project’s mission.
-   Highlight the Women+ (W+) concept and its role in promoting equity and inclusivity in forestry and geospatial research.

2.  Fun Facts: Women in Forestry

-   Share inspiring stories and achievements of women in forestry and Earth Observation (EO) research.
-   Include visuals and interactive elements (e.g., polls, trivia) to engage participants.

3.  Module 1: State-of-the-Art Technologies and Best Practices for EO Data Access & Analysis

-   Overview of cutting-edge EO technologies and relevant tools.
-   Example: Demonstrate how EO data is accessed and analyzed in your research (e.g., LiDAR, remote sensing).
-   Engagement Tip for peer2peer training session: Create a hands-on task where participants try simple data access themselves

4.  Module 2: The Purpose, Importance, and Benefits of Sharing Research Data

-   Discuss the value of open data for collaboration, transparency, and scientific advancement.
-   Examples: Highlight how sharing data has benefited your own research projects.

5.  Module 3: Introduction to Research Data Management (RDM)

-   What is RDM? Define key concepts and explain its significance.
-   Steps Towards Good RDM: Data collection, organization, storage, backup, and sharing.
-   Example: Showcase your own RDM process (e.g., organizing remote sensing datasets).
-   Engagement Tip for peer2peer training session: Use an interactive worksheet where participants outline an RDM plan for a sample dataset.

6.  Module 4: Research Data Repositories

-   What Are Data Repositories? Define and classify types of repositories.
-   TRUST & FAIR Principles: Explain transparency, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability.
-   Example: Share repositories you’ve used, highlighting why they were helpful.

7.  Wrap-Up & Next Steps

-   Summarize key takeaways from the workshop.
-   Share upcoming events and opportunities (peer2peer training sessions) for further learning and collaboration.
-   Encourage participants to join the community (e.g., GitHub, Women+ in Forestry).
